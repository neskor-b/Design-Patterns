# Abstract Factory Pattern

## Description

Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that allows you to create families of related objects without tying them to their concrete classes (refactoring.guru). In other words, Abstract Factory provides an interface for creating a set of interrelated products (for example, a "chair+sofa+table" set in a certain style) without specifying their concrete implementations. This is useful when a system should work with different "families" of objects that need to be used together consistently.

## Key Benefits

- **Consistency**: Ensures that all objects in a family are compatible and work together
- **Flexibility**: Easy to switch between different families of objects
- **Maintainability**: Adding new families doesn't require changing existing code
- **Encapsulation**: Hides the complexity of object creation from the client

## Use Cases

- Creating UI components that need to match a specific theme
- Database connections for different database types
- Cross-platform applications where objects need to be consistent within each platform
- Game development with different character/environment themes

## Structure

The pattern consists of:
- **Abstract Factory**: Defines the interface for creating products
- **Concrete Factories**: Implement the creation of specific product families
- **Abstract Products**: Define interfaces for products
- **Concrete Products**: Implement specific product variants
