# Prototype Pattern

## Description

Prototype is a creational design pattern that allows you to copy objects without going into the details of their implementation (refactoring.guru). Instead of creating an object from scratch (by calling a constructor), the prototype allows you to create a new object based on an existing one - through cloning. This is especially useful when building an object is an expensive operation and you need many similar objects. It is also used for implementing shallow or deep copying of objects.

## Key Benefits

- **Performance**: Avoids expensive object creation operations
- **Flexibility**: Easy to create variations of existing objects
- **Memory efficiency**: Reuses existing object structure
- **Dynamic behavior**: Objects can be modified at runtime
- **Reduced coupling**: Clients don't need to know about concrete classes

## Use Cases

- Creating objects that are expensive to initialize
- Avoiding factory classes for simple object creation
- Implementing object pools
- Creating default configurations
- Game development (spawning similar entities)

## Structure

The pattern consists of:
- **Prototype**: Interface for cloning itself
- **Concrete Prototype**: Implements the cloning operation
- **Client**: Creates new objects by asking a prototype to clone itself

## Types of Copying

- **Shallow Copy**: Copies only the object and its direct properties
- **Deep Copy**: Copies the object and all nested objects recursively

## Example

The example demonstrates how to create car objects by cloning a prototype, showing how multiple similar objects can be created efficiently without repeating the object structure definition.
