# Singleton Pattern

Singleton is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This means that regardless of how many times you access the class, the same object will be created and used. This is useful when you need a single shared resource â€“ for example, a single point of access to a database or global application configuration.
